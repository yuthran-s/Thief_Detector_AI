#  This is a Face recognition project done by Yuthran


This is a POC not fully completed.

The basic idea of the project is to help police recognize their thiefs using a singular database

I am competing for the WAICY competition with two other people and here is our video presentation.

Some back history about me: I am 8th grade student studying in BVM Global

So some of you can share UI ideas.

If you have a powerful computer please change in detect_faces.py in line 45 change it to times_to_upsample=3

And also if you have an interrogated graphics card then change it to cnn (convolutional neural network)

# Steps to get this model working:
    1. Run face_embedding.py and click k for each image
    2. Run detect_faces.py
    
Note: If you want the base detection model go to base_detector.py it has a face detector with those rectangles

The camera and location is default you can add it dynamically too 

Please give some suggestion to improve this project 


# Kudos ðŸ˜Š
